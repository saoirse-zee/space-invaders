## Setup
- [x] Five rows of 11 invaders.
- [ ] The bottom 2 rows score 10 points per large invader.
- [ ] the middle 2 rows 20 points for each medium invader.
- [ ] the top row scores 30 points for each small invader (C). 
- [ ] ‘Mystery’ value spaceships (G) frequently fly from one side of the screen to the other. 
- [ ] Temporary sanctuary can be sought beneath the 4 base shelters (E).

## Rules
- [ ] The invaders randomly fire missiles down the screen from the centre of their bodies. 
- [ ] There are 3 types of missile: slow straight ones, fast straight ones and wiggly ones which are the most powerful. 
- [ ] If a missile hits the player’s laser it is destroyed. 
- [ ] If all the lasers are destroyed the game is over. 
- [ ] The missiles also cause varying degrees of damage to the base shelters. If any invader reaches the bottom of the screen the game ends, no matter how many remaining bases the player has.
- [ ] The invaders travel sideways and each time they touch the side they drop down 1 line. 
- [ ] On screen 1 they need to drop 11 lines to reach the bottom and ‘invade’. From screen 2 through to screen 9 they start progressively lower down the screen. 
- [ ] At screen 10 the game reverts to the screen 1 start position and the cycle begins again.
- [ ] The more invaders the player shoots, the faster the remaining invaders move. 
- [ ] When the invaders are low enough to touch the base shelters they erase them as they pass. 
- [ ] The last invader moves very quickly, but slightly faster left to right than right to left.
- [ ] Any missiles dropped by an invader on the row above ‘invasion’ row will not harm the player’s laser.
- [ ] An invader can have a maximum of 3 missiles on screen at any one time. 
- [ ] The player can have only 1 laser shot on screen at any one time.
- [ ] When an invader’s missile collides with a player’s laser shot, the player’s shot is always destroyed but the invader’s missile occasionally survives, almost certainly if it is a wiggly missile.

## Mystery Ship
The score for a mystery ship is not based on any random event, it is controlled by the number of shots fired by the player before the mystery ship is shot. 
- [ ] On every screen the mystery ship is worth 300 points if hit with the 23rd shot and on every 15th shot until that board ends.
- [ ] The mystery ship appears at regular intervals of roughly 25 seconds.**# 

## Safe place & Wall of death
There is a tactic in space invaders called the ‘wall of death’ (also called the ‘death row’). At a very specific time in the game, the player’s laser base seems to become impervious to the invaders’ missiles! When a line of invaders is on the second to last row (the one before they “invade”) their missiles cannot harm the player’s base. Originally it was assumed to be a bug in the program, but I am fairly sure it was a deliberate feature (maybe the first video game “easter eggs”). Either way, it is a vital feature of the game that can be exploited to reach level 10 and beyond. Shoot the invaders to leave a formation similar to the one in the screen shots below. This is the classic 5 + 1 formation (you can use this technique on almost every board). The trick is to travel with the invades when the last row is hurtling across the screen, shooting them in turn from right to left and hitting the last one just before it overtakes you. Of course, if you miss him you lose a life (but that is the risk you take).
